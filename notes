Starting from scratch (windows environment)

0. Start Spotify
0.5 Install Chocolatey
1. Install Docker
2. Download and unpack zip
3. Notice there's a .idea, download intelliJ community
4. Open in intelliJ, install Docker plugins
4.5 install python 3
5. Read about Conda
5.5 Install Conda choco install anaconda3
6. Have perplexity.ai generate a dockerfile for an anaconda environment
-this is important because it's using a different requirements context than I'm used to, which is requirements.txt
7. Run docker image
- FAILED with error EnvironmentLocationNotFound: Not a conda environment: /opt/conda/envs/app
--app might not be the right name, trying "housing" from the .yml
############# One hour mark
8. Container died with error: python: can't open file '/app/main.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
-pointed to wrong .py, whooops
9. Container now crashing with no logs
-trying to activate and expose ports to keep it running
--was failing because it was running create_model.py before the environment was active
10. can't get it working, trying removing the ENTRYPOINT
11. I can't get conda to work on windows or in intelliJ, don't have time to set up a linux virtual server
12. Miniconda doesn't include the conda activate command, trying anaconda3
-but I did get the container to stay up
13. I've never created an API endpoint, so asking perplexity.ai how to do that
-this is much more difficult that expected
14. changed to bash in the container
-source /etc/profile.d/conda.sh
######## Two hour mark
15. Update dockerfile to run model
16. Attempting a JSON endpoint
-using this example: https://github.com/eaccmk/node-app-http-docker/tree/main
##### break at 2.5 hours
17. changed dockerfile to use bash
18. Can't get conda to activate anymore
### 3 hour end


Notes:
 would create a docker-compose.yml file for manual scaling
 would create a load balancer for autoscaling that could trigger usage of different "docker-copose up --scale mle-project-challenge=$WHATEVER"
